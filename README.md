This boilerplate was bootstrapped from [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The idea for this boilerplate is to provide developers with the following benefits: 

- to start an app with minimal configuration
- to improve productivity
- to become more effective in delivering app features
- to handle scalability in an efficient manner
- to help optimize the app in a way you wouldn't sacrifice your momentum
